SolutionSpaceScanner - a tool for titrating in solution space
===============================================================

SolutionSpaceScanner is a Python package for constructing distinct solvent environments that are then interoperative with the ABSINTH implicit solvent paradigm. It provides a way to generate a customized parameter file which can be read by the CAMPARI all-atom simulation engine to assess how changes to solute-solvent interactions may influence the conformational behaviour of proteins.
