SolutionSpaceScanner - a tool for titrating in solution space
===============================================================

SolutionSpaceScanner is a Python package that allows the systematic modulation of the reference free-energies of solvation (rFOS) values in the ABSINTH implicit solvent model. In this way, distinct types of solutions can be programmed into an ABSINTH parameter file. The SolutionSpaceScanner includes a command-line tool (``sss``) that allows direct reprogramming of the ABSINTH parameter files in a fully customizable way. This documentation provides installation and usage instructions for ``sss``. 

For information on the underlying principles, a brief overview is available in the :ref:`About` section, with more details available in the accompanying manuscript "*Controlling Structural Bias in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Using Solution Space Scanning*" by `Alex S. Holehouse <https://www.holehouselab.com/>`_ and `Shahar Sukenik <https://www.sukeniklab.com/>`_.

The SolutionSpaceScanner package was developed by the `Holehouse Lab at Washington University in St. Louis <http://www.holehouselab.com/>`_. and the `Sukenik Lab at UC Merced <http://www.sukeniklab.com/>`_.

For questions or concers please contact Alex, or open an issue on the `GitHub page <https://github.com/holehouse-lab/solutionspacerscanner>`_.
